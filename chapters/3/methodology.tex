\chapter{Methodology}
\label{chapter:methodology}

Methodology for the study presented in this thesis consists of five major steps. To gain deeper understanding of the problem of information discovery and curation, (1) a systematic literature review was conducted. Based on the literature review, (2) I derived the preliminary information discovery and curation design factors and related them within a framework. (3) The framework was then applied for evaluation of 20 different information discovery applications and iteratively refined after every evaluation. (4) The resulting framework was applied to develop a place photo discovery application. Applying the framework for a Web tool design revealed unforeseen gaps that were consequently addressed. Lastly, (5) the framework was applied to reevaluate some of the tools with the purpose of validating its effectiveness.  A summary of the methodology is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:methodology}.

{\section{Research Questions}
This study is designed to address the problem of designing for information discovery, and it is motivated by the following research questions:

\emph{RQ1: How do existing Web applications support information discovery?}

\emph{RQ2: How do existing information discovery applications support information curation?}
}% end section

{\section{Literature Review}
Development of the framework began with an extensive literature review. A diversity of topics contributed to forming an understanding of information discovery and curation, including information behaviour and information seeking models, high-level Web tasks and modes of Web use, exploration-based models of discovery, and methods of personal and social curation. From this review, the preliminary design factors for the framework were derived. Key findings in current literature are presented in Chapter~\ref{chapter:chapter_related_work}.

{\section{Building and Refining \\the Conceptual Framework}
Through a careful analysis of 20 information discovery applications (see Table~\ref{table:tools}), the framework was iteratevely expanded by adding new concepts and establishing relations between those concepts.  The framework was refined as I explored the literature and available tools, and for presentation purposes int his thesis, I present only two versions of the framework. The first preliminary framework was a result of this tool analysis, and it is depicted in Chapter~\ref{chapter:old_framework}. The final version of the framework (see Chapter~\ref{chapter:framework}) was a result of developing an information discovery application based on the preliminary work.    

For the case study, I selected the most popular information discovery applications in use today and considered the full range of features in those tools (both by referring to the literature and documentation on those tools, as well as exploring the features). The popularity of information discovery applications was determined using Website popularity ranks provided by Alexa\footnote[1]{Alexa is available at www.alexa.com}, a commercial Web traffic data provider. The focus was on applications that had strong information discovery components and lesser priority was given to applications whose purpose revolved only around curation.

I used Yinâ€™s strategies for designing a case study~\cite{yin2014case} for guidance. The motivation behind choosing a case study over other methods of qualitative research was based on my choice of research questions (which have an explanatory nature), the lack of control over existing applications and their development, and having to focus on contemporary use of real-life Web applications. According to Yin~\cite{yin2014case}, a case study would be an optimal research strategy given the above characteristics.

For each case of my study, I chose a Web application whose primary purpose is to support information discovery. I examined the overall purpose of each application, its description as defined within the application, and literature and documentation related to the application (if they were available) against the features that the application provided. For example, if an application provided bookmarking features, I checked if it was indeed intended to be used for information preservation. 

Consequently, the methodology was an iterative process of selecting cases, analyzing them, and determining whether they could be described and evaluated using the framework. If I found a key feature that could not be described, I adapted the framework according to the findings. I repeated the process of case selection and evaluation until the framework was usable for all cases. I then grouped the elements of the framework into categories, recording corresponding questions to ask in order to evaluate applications. 

A list of the tools that were used as cases as well as identifying descriptions for each tool are presented in Table~\ref{table:tools}. Other tools were considered throughout the study, however, only the 20 applications presented underwent systematic examination.

{\section{Applying the Framework to Design\\ an Information Discovery Application}
In order to analyze the framework's capabilities in design for information discovery and curation, I used the framework as a guide for developing a place photo discovery application. Applying the framework to design an application has triggered more changes within the framework, its further extension and refinement. The resulting application is discussed in Chapter~\ref{chapter:application}.
}% end section

{\section{Framework Validation}
In order to finalize the framework, it was applied to reevaluate five of the previously examined tools (see Chapter~\ref{chapter:application}). For each tool, I identifies gaps and proposed directions for future development. 
}% end section

{\section{Limitations}
The case study I conducted has a number of limitations: a lack of documentation, literature, and formal descriptions of available features for some applications introduces a threat to the construct validity of the study. In addition, information discovery tools and features can be used in manners unintended or unforeseen by designers and developers. Therefore, the use of some features within information discovery applications was recorded based on my interpretations. To compensate for such limitations, I employed the tools for personal use over an extended period of time to gain a deeper understanding of their use. In addition, I considered some cases with repeating functionality and design to be able to validate or clarify prior findings. 

Many Web applications rapidly evolve. Therefore, my tool analysis only applies to tools at the moment of the study.

Only Web applications running in browsers on a desktop computer were considered in this study. The study can be extended with use of various devices, such as smartphones and tablets, as information discovery patterns and mechanisms may very for different platforms. 

Another limitation was the lack of prior research studies on the subject matter. Some researchers have studied information seeking models and high-level Web tasks, but there is a lack of literature on how to enable and support different Web tasks. This opens up opportunities for future research to analyze methods of developing and building frameworks for facilitating and evaluating tools that support other Web tasks, such as communication, transactions, and goal realization.
