Development of our framework began with an extensive literature review. Although the previous section outlines only the key research that was considered, it illustrates the diversity of topics that contributed to forming an understanding of information seeking. From this review, we derived preliminary design factors. 

Through a careful analysis of 20 information discovery applications (see Table 1), we iteratively expanded the framework, added concepts, and established relations between those concepts. The framework can be expanded further, however, we selected the most popular information discovery applications in use today and considered the full range of features in those tools (both by referring to the literature and documentation on those tools, as well as exploring the features). The popularity of information discovery applications was determined using Website popularity ranks provided by Alexa\footnote[1]{Alexa is available at www.alexa.com}, a commercial Web traffic data provider. The focus was on applications that had strong information discovery components and lesser priority was given to applications whose purpose revolved only around curation. The framework was refined iteratively as we explored the literature and available tools, and for presentation purposes, we present the final version of the framework.

The exploration of information discovery tools was motivated by the following research questions:
\\

\emph{RQ1: How do existing Web applications support information discovery?}

\emph{RQ2: How do existing information discovery applications support information curation?}\\


We used Yinâ€™s strategies for designing a case study ~\cite{yin} for guidance. The motivation behind choosing a case study over other methods of qualitative research was based on our choice of research questions (which have an explanatory nature), the lack of control over existing applications and their development, and having to focus on contemporary use of real-life Web applications. According to Yin ~\cite{yin}, a case study would be an optimal research strategy given the above characteristics.

For each case of our study, we chose a Web application whose primary purpose is to support information discovery. We examined the overall purpose of each application, its description as defined within the application, and literature and documentation related to the application (if they were available) against the features that the application provided. For example, if an application provided bookmarking features, we checked if it was indeed intended to be used for information preservation. 

To increase external validity of our study, we chose cases based on replication logic ~\cite{yin}. Using replication logic in case study design means carefully selecting each case so that it either predicts analogous results or predicts contrasting results but for anticipated reasons. Therefore, we used our preliminary conceptual framework to predict if an application supported each of the information discovery and curation tasks based on the features that the application provided. If our predictions were inaccurate, we would modify the framework accordingly and move onto the next case. 

Consequently, our methodology was an iterative process of selecting cases, analyzing them, and determining whether they could be described and evaluated using our framework. If we found a key feature that could not be described, we adapted the framework according to the findings. We repeated the process of case selection and evaluation until the framework was usable for all cases. We then grouped the elements of the framework into categories, recording corresponding questions to ask in order to evaluate applications. 

A list of the tools that were used as cases as well as brief summaries of our findings for each tool are presented in Table 1. Summaries are limited and provide a general idea of the results of examining the tools using the framework. Other tools were considered throughout the study, however, only the 20 applications presented underwent systematic examination. The framework itself is covered in the next section and presented in Table 2. Limitations of our study are outlined in Section 7.
