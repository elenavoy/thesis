\chapter{Preliminary Framework}
\label{chapter:old_framework}
The preliminary framework was designed with the goal to support information discovery and curation~\cite{voyloshnikova2014}. The framework is presented in Tables~\ref{}, with the goal to illustrate how the framework evolved.

{\section{Framework Composition}
The framework was built by combining the mechanisms based on the literature.

\textit{Serendipitous discovery} refers to information discovery resulting from serendipitous browsing. Such discovery is characterized by under-defined, absent, or hidden information needs, and it usually involves browsing through diverse resources with varying content types ~\cite{kellar2006, kellar2007}. Here, resource is defined as a collection of information about a single unit of inquiry, usually bundled together for presentation purposes. Some examples of resources are places, images, blog posts, and Web pages.

\textit{Fact discovery} refers to information discovery resulting from the search for a specific piece of information. It is characterized by a well-defined information need and is easier to perform within systems that provide access to homogeneous types of information ~\cite{kellar2006, lindley}.

\textit{Rediscovery} refers to information discovery resulting from revisiting previously discovered resources ~\cite{tauscher}. The following is a list of factors that enable rediscovery.

\textit{Channel-based discovery} can incorporate two different information seeking tasks, monitoring and awareness. It occurs when information is suggested to users based on the content that they are subscribed to. If users can actively look for updates, then an application affords monitoring ~\cite{morrison}. If users can receive notifications about updates, then an application facilitates awareness ~\cite{bates2002, bates1986}. Channel-based information discovery is usually enabled at sites that have regularly updated content, such as Pinterest and YouTube.

{\section{Discussion}
Although the preliminary framework was good at breaking down the tasks that people perform when discovering information, some of the aspects require clarification.
