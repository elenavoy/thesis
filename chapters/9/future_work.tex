\chapter{Future Work and Conclusions }
\label{chapter:future_work}


In our study, we analyzed information curation and seeking tasks and developed a conceptual framework of factors and questions that are important when building and evaluating Web information discovery tools. We then evaluated and iteratively refined the framework by analyzing 20 different information discovery applications and provided concrete examples of tool support addressing various concepts of our framework.

One of the possible future research objectives would be to apply the framework to identify a gap in available information discovery tools, and then further use the framework to design an application that would close that gap. Another potential research question would be to expand our investigation to include the factors that influence the need for one information discovery type over another. 

Our framework opens up opportunities for structured information discovery tool evaluation and design. As more tools are being developed within the social space of information discovery and curation, understanding how these tasks can be supported promises advancements in how Web applications are designed.

Additionally, I would like to investigate how collaboration in information discovery and curation relates to the framework.
