{\section{Improving Navigation}
There are two common ways of aiding information discovery when search-based navigation is used. The first method entails returning personalized results when the user enters a search query. There are a number of ways to accomplish personalization, but this chapter only focuses on which features can can support information discovery and curation have rather than their implementations. The second method is to suggest search terms to make it easier for the user to formulate the information need (see Table~\ref{table:navigation_support}).

To further support referential navigation, applications can either personalize search results (similarly to descriptional navigation) or personalize reference suggestions (see Table~\ref{table:navigation_support}). 

To further enhance random navigation, Web tools sometimes allow users to personalize this type of navigation, which makes it less 'random'. However, this way the user can discover new information within a specific category, for example.

Displayed content can also be personalized to improve information discovery with direct navigation.

Notification mechanisms enable user awareness about new content on the subscribed channel ~\cite{millen}. Different applications provide various notification mechanisms including messages within the application, informative emails, and smartphone notifications.

{\section{Personalization Strategies}
} % end subsection

Providing cognitive support, personalization, and automation dramatically improves user experience when they interact with information discovery and curation systems. Using the information discovery factors in my framework, I described and evaluated currently existing tools. Similarly, the framework can be used for identifying gaps in information discovery support and developing new technologies (see Chapters~\ref{chapter:application} and~\ref{chapter:evaluation}).
